### 🙋‍♂️ About me
🏫 I'm a Computer Science MSc student at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). 

🤓 In the field of CS, I'm interested in low-level programming and distributed systems.

👀 Looking further to learn some languages such as Kotlin and Rust

🆕 I'll keep updating the university and personal projects below, they aren't much but they are little honest works.
