### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science student studying at University of Lisbon. I'm enthusiastic about low-level computation, the complexity of the computer structure keeps fascinating me.

I'll keep updating the projects I developed in university below, they aren't much but they are little honest works :)

Hope you found my repository interesing, new personal projects will also be added here.
